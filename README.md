# Digital Identity Project

### Motivation


In order to access services and institutions, like your gmail or your bank account, we must prove over the internet that we are who we say we are.  

Generally there are 3 ways to prove that you are who you say you are:

1. You know something (username & password)
2. You have something (passport, driver's license)
3. You are something (fingerprint, biometric data)


Up until this point usernames and passwords are the accepted standard for proof of identity over the internet.  However, usernames and passwords are easy to forget and are becoming increasingly less secure.  So why don't we use the other methods?

It is because it has been nearly impossible to prove you have/are something over the internet in a non-invasive manner.  

**Blockchain changes that.  We can now prove that we own a unique digital asset over the internet.  This opens the gateway for a new era of authetication and digtal identity management.**
